# CISP_2410 Assembly Programs
Programs placed here are programs that were written for a computer organization and architecture course. They are written in IA-64 assembly using AT&T syntax.

Feel free to use them as reference for your own projects and assignments, but be warned that if you are using them for school, your institution might flag
them for plagarism if they are simply copied and pasted into an assignment. Also, the .quad data type is used almost exclusively as the only data type throughout
the entirety of the course.

Programs were compiled, ran, and debugged in [Online GDB](https://www.onlinegdb.com/), but this could be done in a desktop environment as well with the right
tools.
